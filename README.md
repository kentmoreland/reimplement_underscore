# Reimplement Underscore.js
My reimplementation of the Underscore.js functional programming library. 
This exercise is to serve as a conduit for my better understanding of functional programming methods. 

The intent is to recreate the most common underscore methods from scratch and refine them as I learn more efficient programming concepts.
